## Setup Instructions

### 1. Fork the Repository

Fork the GitHub repository into your account to start working on your own copy.

### 2. Configure Jenkins

- **Webhook Setup**:  
  Configure a GitHub webhook to trigger Jenkins builds automatically upon code push.  
  *Reference*: [GitHub & Jenkins Webhooks Integration](https://www.hatica.io/blog/github-jenkins-webhooks-integration/)

- **Tool Integration**:
  - **Maven**: Integrate Maven to handle the build and testing phases.
  - **SonarQube**: Connect SonarQube for static code analysis and quality control.
  - **Docker & AWS**: Set up Docker for containerization and integrate AWS for deployment.
  
- **Example Jenkins Pipeline Snippet**:
  ```groovy
  pipeline {
      agent any
      stages {
          stage('Checkout') {
              steps {
                  git 'https://github.com/your-repo'
              }
          }
          stage('Build & Test') {
              steps {
                  sh 'mvn clean install'
              }
          }
          stage('Static Analysis') {
              steps {
                  sh 'mvn sonar:sonar'
              }
          }
          stage('Package') {
              steps {
                  sh 'docker build -t your-app .'
              }
          }
          stage('Deploy') {
              steps {
                  // Deployment script for AWS EC2 or EKS
                  sh './deploy.sh'
              }
          }
      }
  }
3. Define Quality Gates in SonarQube
Establish quality metrics and thresholds to ensure that code meets your standards.

Review SonarQube setup and integration via Jenkins for continuous feedback.

EKS: For Kubernetes-based orchestration.

Configure AWS CLI to manage infrastructure and deploy your application.

Pipeline Workflow
Code Checkout

Jenkins pulls the latest code from GitHub when changes are pushed.

Build & Test

Maven compiles the code and runs unit tests.

References:

Jenkins Build Step Documentation

Jenkins Continuous Deployment Guide

Static Analysis

SonarQube scans the code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.

Reference: Jenkins & SonarQube Integration – Key Features

Artifact Storage

Nexus stores build artifacts for version control and rollback capabilities.

References:

Nexus Plugin for Jenkins

Maven Deploy to Nexus Guide

Docker Packaging

The application is containerized and pushed to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

Building Docker Image with Jenkins

Deployment

Kubernetes/EKS deploys the Docker image to AWS.

Detailed Technical Concepts
1. Version Control (Git/GitHub)
Overview:
Manages code revisions and facilitates team collaboration.

Best Practices:

Utilize branching strategies (feature branches, main branch protection).

Write clear and consistent commit messages.

Troubleshooting:

Resolve merge conflicts using Git commands and visual merge tools.

2. CI/CD Server (Jenkins)
Overview:
Automates the integration, testing, and deployment processes.

Configuration Steps:

Set up a GitHub webhook to trigger builds.

Integrate necessary plugins for Maven, SonarQube, Docker, and AWS.

Best Practices:

Maintain clean job configurations.

Regularly monitor build logs for early detection of issues.

Troubleshooting Tips:

Inspect Jenkins logs for errors.

Verify plugin configurations and connectivity.

Reference: GitHub & Jenkins Webhooks Integration

3. Build Tool (Maven)
Overview:
Handles project builds, dependency management, and testing.

Configuration:

Update pom.xml to include the necessary plugins and dependencies.

Use the command: mvn clean install

Best Practices:

Keep dependencies and plugin versions consistent.

Troubleshooting Tips:

Check for errors in pom.xml and resolve dependency conflicts.

spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: your-app
  template:
    metadata:
